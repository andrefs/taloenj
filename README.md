# taloenj:  "Print your phone pictures using a thermal printer"


`taloenj` is a node.js web app which allows you to upload pictures and sends them to the Sparkfun/Adafruit/... thermal printer

It includes:

* a web app to upload your pictures and edit their contrast and
  brightness
* an API to talk with the thermal printer


## Simple setup

The most simple setup is connecting the thermal printer directly
to your computer.

### Required hardware

* A thermal printer (sold from [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/product/597), [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10438), [InMotion](http://www.inmotion.pt/pt/adafruit/983-mini-thermal-receipt-printer.html), etc)
* FTDI basic breakout
  ([example](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716))
* A computer

### External dependencies

* imagemagick (Ubuntu or Debian-based distros)

### Setup and installation

Connect it like this:

 You'll need to install Taloenj:

    npm install -g taloenj

In order to be able to run without `sudo` permissions, you must
make sure your use is in the dialout group:

    sudo adduser YOUR_USER dialout

log out and log back in.

## Advanced setup suggestion: portable Taloenj

This alternative setup aims to make Taloenj portable, fitting
everything into a little self powered box. Furthermore, it creates its
own wifi network, allowing the users to connect wireless with their
phones and upload the pictures directly.

(TBD)

### Additional hardware

In addition to the hardware required for the [Simple
Setup](#required-hardware), you'll need:

* Raspberry Pi
* WiFi dongle ([example](http://www.dx.com/p/ultra-mini-nano-usb-2-0-802-11n-150mbps-wifi-wlan-wireless-network-adapter-48166))
* Power bank(s) capable of powering both the Pi and the printer

* A box where it all fits
