# taloenj:  "Print your phone pictures using a thermal printer"


`taloenj` is a node.js web app which allows you to upload pictures and sends them to the Sparkfun/Adafruit/... thermal printer

It includes:

* a web app to upload your pictures and edit their contrast and
  brightness
* an API to talk with the thermal printer


## Install and simple setup

    npm install -g taloenj

    In order to be able to run without `sudo` permissions, you must
    make sure your use is in the dialout group:

        sudo adduser YOUR_USER dialout

    log out and log back in.

### External dependencies

* imagemagick (Ubuntu or Debian-based distros)

### Required hardware

## Advanced setup suggestion

TBD

### Additional hardware

* Raspberry Pi
* WiFi dongle
